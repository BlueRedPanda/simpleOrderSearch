simpleOrderSearch


I want to asses your ability to create a web application and web service. It truly is the bare minimum of knowledge necessary to be successful in this position. I don't want you to spend a lot of time on this. You should be able to do this in a few hours if the job is right for you.

Order Search
This programming task consists of building a simple web application to search for orders. Fork this repository and create your application. It should take this input from the user:

(Order Number || (Region && Supplier)) && Date

The application will call a service that you create using C#. I have provided some sample data for the application in this file

Order Documents

The file contains an array whose elements represent orders. The data should be defined as a constant in your service.

The application calling the service can be a console app. You have total freedom to do what you want but make sure it can do these two things:

• Validate that the user has provided the right criteria to make a search 
• Write the outputs of the service call to a console window. 
Create a pull request once you have it working. I will clone your repository, verify that it works, and evaluate it.
